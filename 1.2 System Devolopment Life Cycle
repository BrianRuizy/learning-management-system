1.3	System Development Life Cycle => Evolutionary Model 
Apply the knowledge you learned from the class, apply 2D life cycle models on the project. Select the suitable life cycle models and present your reasons. 

We are using the Code and Fix model.  Due to time and knowledge constraints this is the only usable model.

This project has no long term maintance needs, so it is not neccesary to consider future devolopment.
